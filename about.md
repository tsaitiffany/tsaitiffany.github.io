Hello friends! My name is Tiffany Tsai, and I am a student at the University of Texas studying computer science. I love ice cream, being artsy fartsy, calligraphy, and have a passion for capturing all the moments that make up the journey of life. If you'd like to work together to document a special moment, such as a graduation, engagement, or anything in between, please click the mail icon below to get in touch!
